# Credit-vs-Equity-Beta
Beta computation among equity and credit default swap: the importance of RISKY annuity measure.

# Abstract

* Through the consideration of four Credit Default Swap (CDX North Amer- ica IG, CDX HY, iTraxx Main, iTraxx Crossover) and three stock indices (SPY, SX5E, IWM), in this paper we aim to present the Credit and Equity Beta coef- ficient result. The main purpose of this analysis is to underline the differences between the level of volatility of the examined financial instruments. We have developed a simple return and a mark-to-market analysis for every index, fo- cusing, then, on two chosen financial instrument: CDX North America IG and SPY. In the light of that, we have proceeded the study calculating the Beta (Î²) for the two financial instruments, showing how much an equity value can influence a portfolio more than a CDS.
